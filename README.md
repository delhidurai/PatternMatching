#####Project Name :- Pattern Matching using KMP and Rabin Karp

Pattern matching is one of the fundamental problems in computer science. The advent of world wide web, next generation sequencing and increased use of satellite imaging have all contributed to the current information explosion. Out of all these one of the fundamental tasks that is common to many applications, is identifying the patterns within the available data. Pattern matching is the ability to find patterns within a given set of data. Some common use of pattern matching are
a.	Search of patterns in a DNA sequences
b.	Text search within a document
c.	Plagiarism detection


This project specifically focusses on implementing pattern matching on a given string or text. It implements pattern matching using two well know algorithms Rabin Karp and Knuth-Morris-Pratt and compares its performance, processing time, memory usage against a set of predefined data objects.
