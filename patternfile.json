This challenge presents a curated collection of datasets from 20 global sources and asks you to model solutions to key questions that were developed and evaluated by a global frontline of healthcare providers, hospitals, suppliers, and policy makers Dataset Description This dataset is composed of a curated collection of over 200 publicly available COVID-19 related datasets from sources like Johns Hopkins, the WHO, the World Bank, the New York Times, and many others. It includes data on a wide variety of potentially powerful statistics and indicators, like local and national infection rates, global social distancing policies, geospatial data on movement of people, and more. Challenge Details The tasks associated with this dataset were developed and evaluated by global frontline healthcare providers, hospitals, suppliers, and policy makers. They represent key research questions where insights developed by the Kaggle community can be most impactful in the areas of at-risk population evaluation and capacity management.To participate in this challenge, review the research questions posed in the dataset tasks and submit solutions in the form of Kaggle Notebooks.We encourage participants to use the presented data and if needed, their own proprietary and non-proprietary datasets to create their submissions.  Timeline  The goal of the UNCOVER challenge is to connect the AI community with the frontline of responders to this global crisis, therefore the Roche Data Science Coalition will be evaluating solutions and surfacing this research to experts on the following schedule:Wednesday, April 22nd Wednesday, May 13th Wednesday, June 3rd On each of those dates, each task will have one submission identified as the best response to the research question posed in the task. That submission will be marked as the “accepted solution” to that task, and will be reevaluated by the next deadline against the new research contributed to that task. Submissions will be reviewed on a rolling basis, so participants are encouraged to work publicly and collaboratively to accelerate the research available for each task. Roche Canada will be inviting the authors of accepted task submissions to present their solutions to a panel of Roche leadership for potential application and scale in various regions across the globe. Accessing the Data Datasets have been made available here on Kaggle and are intermittently being updated from their respective sources.  You may also access the datasets through the Namara platform to get the most up to date version of each dataset,publicly thanks to our collaborators at ThinkData Works. Details on the provenance of each dataset are available in the file descriptions of each folder. Acknowledgement Hoffmann-La Roche Limited (Roche Canada) is committed to working with the global community to develop solutions to the challenges of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) publicly pandemic. We believe that an important way in which the world can win this fight is through the sharing of knowledge and healthcare data to better inform patient care and health system decision making. To help achieve this, we have assembled a group of like-minded public and private organizations with a common mission and vision to bring actionable intelligence to patients, frontline healthcare providers, institutions, supply chains, and government. We call ourselves the Roche Data Science Coalition. We’d like to thank our publicly collaborators who are part of the Roche Data Science Coalition:"

They represent key research questions where insights developed by the Kaggle community can be most impactful in the areas of at-risk population evaluation and capacity management.To participate in this challenge, review the research questions posed in the dataset tasks and submit solutions in the form of Kaggle Notebooks.We encourage participants to use the presented data and if needed, their own proprietary and non-proprietary datasets to create their submissions.  Timeline  The goal of the UNCOVER challenge is to connect the AI community with the frontline of responders to this global crisis, therefore the Roche Data Science Coalition will be evaluating solutions and surfacing this research to experts on the following schedule:Wednesday, April 22nd Wednesday, May 13th Wednesday, June 3rd On each of those dates, each task will have one submission identified as the best response to the research question posed in the task. That submission will be marked as the “accepted solution” to that task, and will be reevaluated by the next deadline against the new research contributed to that task. Submissions will be reviewed on a rolling basis, so participants are encouraged to work publicly and collaboratively to accelerate the research available for each task. Roche Canada will be inviting the authors of accepted task submissions to present their solutions to a panel of Roche leadership for potential application and scale in various regions across the globe. Accessing the Data Datasets have been made available here on Kaggle and are intermittently being updated from their respective sources.

Acknowledgement Hoffmann-La Roche Limited (Roche Canada) is committed to working with the global community to develop solutions to the challenges of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) publicly pandemic. We believe that an important way in which the world can win this fight is through the sharing of knowledge and healthcare data to better inform patient care and health system decision making. To help achieve this, we have assembled a group of like-minded public and private organizations with a common mission and vision to bring actionable intelligence to patients, frontline healthcare providers, institutions, supply chains, and government. We call ourselves the Roche Data Science Coalition. We’d like to thank our publicly collaborators who are part of the Roche Data Science Coalition: Challenge Description:The Roche Data Science Coalition (RDSC) is requesting the collaborative effort of the AI community to fight COVID-19. This challenge presents a curated collection of datasets from 20 global sources and asks you to model solutions to key questions that were developed and evaluated by a global frontline of healthcare providers, hospitals, suppliers, and policy makers Dataset Description This dataset is composed of a curated collection of over 200 publicly available COVID-19 related datasets from sources like Johns Hopkins, the WHO, the World Bank, the New York Times, and many others. It includes data on a wide variety of potentially powerful statistics and indicators, like local and national infection rates, global social distancing policies, geospatial data on movement of people, and more. Challenge Details The tasks associated with this dataset were developed and evaluated by global frontline healthcare providers, hospitals, suppliers, and policy makers. They represent key research questions where insights developed by the Kaggle community can be most impactful in the areas of at-risk population evaluation and capacity management.To participate in this challenge, review the research questions posed in the dataset tasks and submit solutions in the form of Kaggle Notebooks.We encourage participants to use the presented data and if needed, their own proprietary and non-proprietary datasets to create their submissions.  Timeline  The goal of the UNCOVER challenge is to connect the AI community with the frontline of responders to this global crisis, therefore the Roche Data Science Coalition will be evaluating solutions and surfacing this research to experts on the following schedule:Wednesday, April 22nd Wednesday, May 13th Wednesday, June 3rd On each of those dates, each task will have one submission identified as the best response to the research question posed in the task. That submission will be marked as the “accepted solution” to that task, and will be reevaluated by the next deadline against the new research contributed to that task. Submissions will be reviewed on a rolling basis, so participants are encouraged to work publicly and collaboratively to accelerate the research available for each task. Roche Canada will be inviting the authors of accepted task submissions to present their solutions to a panel of Roche leadership for potential application and scale in various regions across the globe. Accessing the Data Datasets have been made available here on Kaggle and are intermittently being updated from their respective sources.
